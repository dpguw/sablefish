0.4.1 ongoing
o capHistConvert(): Corrected the formatting of the documentation.
o capHistSum(): Corrected the documentation.  Added a second example.
o Garvey1: Added.  Used in examples in ks2d1().
o Garvey4a: Added.  Used in examples in ks2d1().
o ks2d(): Deleted, changed to ks2d2().
o ks2d1(): Added.
o ks2d2(): Added, was ks2d().
o ks2dp(): Deleted, changed to ks2d2p().
o ks2d2p(): Added, was ks2dp().
o mrClosed(): Changed all "messages" using cat() to using message() so that they
    can be suppressed with suppressMessage() or message=FALSE in knitr.  See 
    "One comment on messages" at http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/output/.
o pkolgomorov1x(): Added to FSAinternals (from ks2d()).

0.4.0 Jun13
o Corrected all pointers to fishR vignettes (because of new webpage).
o Removed importFrom color.scale from plotrix because of changes to discharge()
    and wetPerim().
o removed importFrom &#37;nin&#37; from Hmisc.  See multiple changes because of this below.

o .onAttach(): Added, was .onLoad().
o .onLoad(): Deleted, now .onAttach().
o addMargins(): Deleted, moved back to NCStats.
o addSigLetters(): Deleted, moved back to NCStats.
o addZeroCatch(): Modified.  Changed the looping structure for finding the sampling
    event and species combinations that need zeroes.  This should speed things up
    substantially.  Also, modified to allow no idvar variables.  Finally, the
    returned data frame has the variables (columns) in the same order as the
    original data frame (rather than having the order modified).
o ageComp(): Modified some of the code to adjust for name changes in Summarize().
    Modified to use a formula notation.
o ageKey(): Modified to using a formula notation.  This removed the dl=, cl=,
    and ca= arguments.  Made minor adjustments to the help pages (in addition to
    changes related to the argument modifications).
o bcFuns(): Removed use of &#37;nin&#37;.
o capFirst(): Modified so that ONLY the first letter is capitalized (previous
    version would de-capitalize the first letter in the second word but leave
    the rest of the letters capitalized).
o capHistSum(): Modified to correct an error that occurred when computing the
    Method B table when a capture history occurred only once or not at all.
o chapmanRobson(): Modified by adding the Hoenig et al. (1983) bias correction
    formula for the estimate of Z as the default option.
o confint.nlsBoot(): Removed use of &#37;nin&#37;.
o discharge(): Deleted, moved to NCStats (to reduce overhead here).
o histStack(): Modified by adding a formula method (histStack.formula()) which
    required adding a default method (histStack.default()).
o htest.nlsBoot(): Removed use of &#37;nin&#37;.
o lencat(): Modified by changing to using a formula notation and a data= argument.
    This means that the df= and cl= arguments are no longer used.  In addition, 
    the warning about fish larger than the larger category has been turned off.
    The method to handle this was not changed, the warning was just turned off.
o lencatOLD(): Added as an internal file to temporarily allow me not to change all
    functions that were affected by the changes to lencat().  The functions that
    required this are emp() and wsValidate().
o lenFreqExpand(): Modified to deal with lencat() change.
o limnoProfilePlot(): Deleted, moved to NCStats (to reduce overhead here).
o mrClosed(): Removed use of &#37;nin&#37;.
o plotBinResp(): Modified by moving makeColor() internal function to FSA-internals
    so that it can also be used by tictactoe().
o predict.bootCase(): Added.
o PSSLit: added from RSDLit.  Added from Ogle and Winfield (2009) for ruffe,
    Bonvechio et al. (2010) for Suwannee bass, and from Phelps and Willis (2013)
    for several "carp" species.
o PSSLitCheck(): Added this internal file.  Modified pssVal(), pssCalc(), and 
    pssPlot() accordingly.
o psdVal(): Deprecated, will delete, became pssVal().
o pssCalc(): Added, was rsdCalc().  Modified to using a formula notation and a
    data= argument.
o pssDataPrep(): Added.
o pssPlot(): Added, was rsdPlot().  Modified to using a formula notation and a
    data= argument, to handle the default change for incl.zero in pssVal(), and
    changed the default pss.lty= settings.
o pssVal(): Added, was rsdVal().  Changed incl.zero=TRUE to be the default.
o recodeSpecies(): Added.
o rsdCalc(): Deleted, became pssCalc().
o rsdLit(): Deleted, became PSSLit().
o rsdPlot(): Delted, became pssPlot().
o rsdVal(): Deprecated, will delete, became pssVal().
o sigLetters(): Deleted, cld() in multcomp has been modified to deprecate this.
o simLenSelect(): Modified to deal with lencat() change.
o Summarize(): Modified by calculating the percentage of zeroes for quantitative
    data.  Also changed the names in the returned vectors or data frames to 
    reduce capitalization, spaces, and punctuation.  Removed use of &#37;nin&#37;.
o tictactoe(): Modified by changing the way the "in balance" regions are depicted.
    This resulted in the addition of the bal.trans= argument.
o tictactoeAdd(): Modified by changing PSD labels to PSS.
o vbStarts(): Removed use of &#37;nin&#37;.
o wetPerim(): Deleted, moved to NCStats (to reduce overhead here).
o wrAdd(): Modified.  Major modifications to account for changes to WSlit.
    Added the capFirst() check for species name.  Changed subNA= to 
    remove.submin= to make consistent with wrDataPrep().
o wrDataPrep(): Added.
o wrVal(): Deleted.
o WSlit: Modified.  Completely rebuilt so that quadratic equation using EmP could
    be incorporated into the database.  Also added equations for several new species.
o WSLitCheck(): Added this internal file.  Modified wsVal(), wrVal(), and 
    wrAdd() accordingly.
o wsVal(): Modified.  A major modification to account for the major changes to WSLit.
o wsValidate(): Removed use of &#37;nin&#37;.


0.3.4 Jan13
o added special "fishR Vignette" sections with links to several help files.

o binCI(): Modified so that result is a matrix rather than sometimes (when only
    one set of CIs were computed) being a vector.
o catchCurve(): Modified by minorly adjusting how confint() produced CIs.  Also,
    disallowed using parm= when the user asks for CIs for the linear model.  This
    allowed using match.arg() as a check for appropriate parm= values.  Modified
    the examples in the help file slightly and added an example of using the 
    weighted regression method.
o plot.catchCurve(): Modified so that log(catch) values less than 0 will be plotted.
o chapmanRobson(): Modified by minorly adjusting how confint() produced CIs.
o depletion(): Modified by minorly adjusting how confint() produced CIs and added
    a cat()ted output to the summary() method describing whether the Leslie or
    DeLury method was used.
o growthModelSim(): Modified.  Streamlined the code (removed some "junk" and
    unneeded redundancies).  Also corrected the error where the fourth parameter
    in the vbSchnute and Schnute were not observed to be connected to sliders.
    Also changed a few default slider values.  Also set the minimum age (t.min)
    to 0 and cannot be over-ridden (was previously controlled by a slider).  Thus,
    removed the minimum age slider.  Also moved the maximum age slider to the
    bottom of the sliders.  Changed the calls for the Gompertz models to use the
    full name (i.e., Gompertz1 instead of Gomp1).  Changed model= to type= to be
    more consistent with other similar functions.
o hyperCI(): Modified so that the result is a matrix rather than a vector.
o leslieSim(): Modified by adding hscale=1.5 to resampling version.
o mrClosed(): Modified to handle the changes in hyperCI() and binCI().  Also modified
    messages in summary() and confint() (to streamline).
o predict.nlsBoot(): Added.
o removal(): Modified by minorly adjusting how confint() produced CIs and removed
    a cat()ted line from the summary() method.  Also, modified the "catches" for
    the 2- and 3-pass specific methods to disallow using anything but a vector
    with either 2 or 3 samples.
o srCobWeb(): Added.
o srSim(): Modified.  Streamlined the code (lots of "junk" code that did not do
    anything and some unneeded redundancies) were removed.  Modified the default
    values and the axis labels so as to produce generally more interesting
    simulations.  Modified the graphic to show the peak recruitment level and, if
    a Ricker model, the stock size where the peak recruitment occurs.  Changed a
    long series of if-else for the different parametrizations to a switch().
    Changed model= to type= to be consistent with other srXXX functions.
o vbFuns(): Modified slightly the messages if msg=TRUE.  Added a message for the
    Wang2 model and corrected an error for the Somers2 model.
o view(): Modified to remove the ability to print to a window (use method built
    into RStudio instead).  Also generalized to use for both a matrix or a
    data.frame (eliminates some warning messages).


0.3.3 21Dec12
o Added ImportFrom for slider() and gslider() from the relax package.  Deleted the
    ImportFrom for slider() from the TeachingDemos package.  These functions were
    the same but it was being deprecated from TeachingDemos.
o General: added call.=FALSE to several stop()s and warning()s.
o General: replaced paste() inside of several cat()s.

o ageKey(): Modified to use match.arg() with type=.
o binCI(): Modified to use ciLabel() (see below).
o catchCurveSim(): Modified in a variety of ways.  First, moved the ability to 
    control the recruitment age and the steadiness of the Z and No changes to
    function arguments rather than slider controls.  Second, streamlined the internal
    functions.  Third, converted to using gslider() instead of slider().  Fourth,
    made minor cosmetic changes to the plot.  Fifth, I edited the help file somewhat.
o checkStartcatW(): Added this internal function.

o fsaNews(), FSANews(): Renamed versions of fsa.news() and FSA.news().
o FSAsims(): Deleted.  Rarely used and not supported in non-windows and RStudio.
o growthModelSim(): Modified in a variety of ways.  First, streamlined the internal
    functions so that the plot can be created individually.  Second, converted to
    using gslider() instead of slider().
o hyperCI(): Modified to use ciLabel().
o lencat(): Modified by using the new checkStartcatW() internal function.
o lenFreqExpand(): Modified by adding show.summary= argument and using the new
    checkStartcatW() internal function.
o leslieSim(): Modified in a variety of ways.  First, combined the code from 
    leslieSim2() into this function.  This required deleting the use.rand=
    argument and adding a type= argument.  In addition, the leslieRandRun() internal
    function was moved to this R document (from FSA-internals).  Second, the functions
    were all streamlined with new internal functions.  Third, converted to using
    gslider() instead of slider().  Fourth, made minor cosmetic changes to each
    plot (including adding a small legend to the old leslieSim2()).
o leslieSim2(): Deleted.  See leslieSim().
o lwModelSim(): Modified in a variety of ways.  First, streamlined the internal
    functions so that the plot can be created individually (will ultimately allow
    use of the manipulate package).  Second, converted to using gslider() instead
    of slider().
o mrClosed(): Modified by removing numdigs= argument.
o mrClosed1Sim(): Modified in a variety of ways.  First, streamlined the internal
    functions so that the plot can be created individually.  Second, converted to
    using gslider() instead of slider().
o poiCI(): Modified to use ciLabel().
o rlp(): Modified by replacing decimals= argument with digits= argument.
o srSim(): Modified in a variety of ways.  First, streamlined the internal
    functions so that the plot can be created individually.  Second, converted to
    using gslider() instead of slider().  Third, removed the S3methods.
o Summarize() Modified by removing numdigs= argument.
o TroutDietSL: Added for use with dietOverlap().
o vbStarts(): Modified by including a catch for negative starting values of K or
    starting values of Linf that are 50% smallr or larger than the observed maximum
    length in the data set.


0.3.2 1Dec12
o Changed R dependency to >2.14.0.
o Added a ImportsFrom for knitr (purl() in swvCode() added below).
o Moved gdata to an ImportsFrom from Suggests.  Needed for nobs() in ci.fp1() which
    is used in fitPlot.ONEWAY and drop.levels() used in the example in RuffeWs.
o Deleted dependency on FSAdata.

o Added the following data files from FSAdata: BluegillJL, BluegillLM, BrookTroutTH,
    CodNorwegian, CutthroatAL, Ecoli, KS2D_NR, LMBassWs, Mirex, PikeNY, PikeNYPartial1,
    RSDlit, RuffeWs, SMBassLS, SMBassWB, SpotVA1, StripedBass1, VBGMlit, WalleyeGerowLW,
    WR79, WSlit.  This allowed removing the depending on FSAdata.
o .onLoad(): modified slightly with a suggestion from Simon Urbanek to eliminate
    a warning on RCMD Check (that showed up on rforge.net, but not locally).
o addMargins(): added from NCStats.
o addSigLetters(): added from NCStats.  Modified to allow the use of a result from
    sigLetters() in lets=.

o lsmean(): deleted.  Functionality is replaced by lsmeans() in the lsmeans package.
o psdVal(), rsdCalc(), rsdVal(), rsdPlot(): added code to eliminate "global bindings"
    note when performing RCMD Check.  Solutions came from Adrian Alexa's response
    to this question: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/cambridge-r-user-group/c7vf8o3QwDo
o sigLetters(): added.  Hopefully this will eventually be replaced by changed to
    cld() in the multcomp package.
o Summarize(): made some warning messages more concise.
o swvCounts(), swvPvalue(), swvANOVA(), swvGLHT(), swvREG(), swvHtest(), swvCode(),
    swvFinish(): added from miscOgle.
o view(): added from NCStats.
o wsVal(), wrAdd(): added code to eliminate "global bindings" note when performing
    RCMD Check.  Solutions came from Adrian Alexa's response to this question:
    https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/cambridge-r-user-group/c7vf8o3QwDo


0.3.1 25Nov12
o Switched to using the Project mode in RStudio.
o Switched to using semantic versioning for the version number (which means that
    the hyphen before the last number has been replaced by a period).
o Switched to using roxygen to construct help files.
o Set some values =NULL to eliminate "global bindinds" warning when performing
    the RCMD check -- emp(), pos2adj(), psdVal(), simAgeBias(), srStarts(), 
    vbStarts(), and wsValidate().  This did not work for the WSlit and RSDlit
    problems in rsdCalc(), rsdPlot(), rsdVal() and wsVal().
o Added an importFrom for lineplot.CI()) and se() from sciplot (used in fitPlot()).
o Added an importFrom for outlierTest() from car for use in residPlot().
o Deleted importFrom for alias() from stats (was used in wlgm()).
o Deleted importFrom for boxcox() from MASS (was used in wlgm()).
o Deleted depends on NCStats (moved many functions here (see below) and then 
    made NCStats depend on FSA).
o Deleted suggests for exactRankTests (apparently no longer needed).
o Moved nlstools from depends to suggests (only needed for an example in 
    confint.nlsboot that is not run because of the time required).
o Moved plotrix from depends to importsFrom for color.scale(), plotCI(), and
    thigmophobe().
o Moved quantreg from depends to importsFrom for rq() (used in emp()).
o Attempted to move reshape to importsFrom but had problems with missing
    is.formula() from plyr.

o ageComp(): modified class name to "ageComp" from "AgeComp".
o capFirst(): added.
o catchCurve(): modified class name to "catchCurve" from "CC".
o chapmanRobson(): modified class name to "chapmanRobson" from "CR".
o coefPlot(): deleted (Weisberg's LGM is now out-dated).
o depletion(): modifed class name to "depletion" from "Depletion".
o discharge(): modified class name to "discharge" from "StrmDschrg".
o emp(): modified class names to "empXX" from "EMPxx".
o fitPlot(): added from NCStats.
o FroeseWs(): modified class name to "FroeseWs" from "FROESE".
o histStack(): added.
o hoCoef(): added from NCStats.
o ks2d(): modified class name to "ks2d" from "ks2d".
o ks2dp(): modified class name to "ks2dp" from "ks2dp".
o legendHelp(): added (internal) from NCStats.
o mrClosed(): modified by moving the two internal functions -- mrc1() and mrc2() --
    to inside mrClosed, moving the two internal functions -- ci.mrc1() and
    ci.mrc2() -- to inside confint.mrClosed(), removed the "MRC1" and "MRC2"
    classes, changed the "MRC" class name to "mrClosed", and added a catch to
    plot.mrClosed() to stop if the user tries to plot with single-census data.
o mrOpen(): modified class name to "mrOpen" from "MRO".
o plotBinResp(): added from NCStats.
o plotH(): minor modifications to the Rd file.
o pos2adj(): modified the labels for the positions by including full names for 
    all directions, eliminating the single letters for the four main directions,
    but also leaving the four "off" directions as abbreviations.
o psdVal(), rsdVal(), rsdCalc(), rsdPlot(): modified to use capFirst so that the
    user does not need to focus on capitalization of the species name.
o removal(): modified class name to "removal" from "Removal".
o residPlot(): added from NCStats.
o rlp(): modified class name to "rlp" from "RLP".
o Summarize(): added from NCStats.

o wetPerim(): modified class name to "wetPerim" from "WetPerim".
o wlgm(): deleted (Weisberg's LGM is now out-dated).
o wsValidate(): modified the classnames to "willis" from "WILLIS" and "empq" from
    "EMPQ".  Also made minor modification because of class name change in FroeseWs()
o ycPlot(): deleted (Weisberg's LGM is now out-dated).


0.3-0 8-Nov-12
o Moved several functions from NCStats that are used quite often for fisheries
    analyses.  Ultimately, I want to remove the dependency to NCStats.
o Deleted an importFrom for gtools, created an internal odd() instead.
o Added an importFrom for gplots, to get rich.colors() for chooseColors().
o Added an importFrom and removed an import for NCStats.

o ageComp(): modified to use internal odd(), rather than odd() imported from gtools.
o binCI(): moved from NCStats.
o chooseColors(): copied from NCStats (i.e., same function still in NCStats).
o confint.nlsBoot(): moved from NCStats.
o fact2num(): moved from NCStats.
o htest(): copied from NCStats (i.e., same function still in NCStats).
o htest.nlsBOot(): moved from NCStats.
o hyperCI(): moved from NCStats.
o ks2d(): moved from NCStats.
o ks2dp(): moved from NCStats.
o ksTest(): moved from NCStats.
o lagratio(): moved from NCStats.
o lsmean(), and related internals: moved from NCStats.
o mrClosed(): modified so as not to depend on ci.t() from NCStats.
o plotH(): moved from NCStats.
o poiCI(): moved from NCStats.
o popSizesPlot(): moved from NCStats.
o pos2adj(): moved from NCStats.
o rcumsum(): moved from NCStats.
o rsdPlot(): modified to handle situations where substock fish are not present in
    the data.  Thanks to Max Wolter for pointing out this issue.
o Subset(): copied from NCStats (i.e., same function still in NCStats).


0.2-8 21Jun12
o Switched to compiling under R version 2.14.1 (64-bit).
o Changed license specification from "GPL version 2 or newer" to "GPL (>= 2)" to
    avoid warning on check.
o Added a suggestion for gdata to fix warning with capHistConver.rd (see below).

o capHistConvert.rd: Modified the examples to not use "gdata::combine" by adding
    a "require(gdata)" in the examples and suggesting gdata in the description file.
o fishR(): Added.
o simAgeBias(): changed width to widths in layout() to avoid warning on check.
o simLenSelectM(): changed width to widths in layout() to avoid warning on check.

0.2-7 2Mar12
o .onLoad(): Modified.  Moved the startup message into packageStartupMessage()
    in hopes of eliminating the warning when checking the package.
o catchCurveSim(): Modified.  Changed max.age= to 15 (from 10).  Slightly changed
    the labels related to 'Z Steady' and 'No Steady'.
o chapmanRobson(): Modified.  Corrected a bug for when the ages2use= argument
    contains ages that are not found in the data.  Thanks to Eric Berglund for
    finding this bug.
o psdVal(): Modified.  As described for rsdVal().
o rsdCalc(): Added.
o rsdPlot(): Modified.  Modified to reflect changes in rsdVal().
o rsdVal(): Modified.  Removed the metric= and mm= arguments in favor of a new
    argument, units=, where the user chooses the units as a string.  This
    streamlines, for example, the selection of mm.  The modifications also
    resulted in mm being the default.  Also, removed the appended units names
    from the names attribute -- i.e., "stock" rather than "stock.mm" or "stock.in".
o wrAdd(): Added.
o wrVal(): Modified.  As described for wsVal().
o wsVal(): Modified.  Removed the justcoef= argument.  Added the ab= and comment=
    arguments.  Also, removed the appended units names from the names attribute
    -- i.e., "int" rather than "int.E" or "int.mm".
    
0.2-6 1Oct11
o Switched to compiling under R version 2.13.1 (32-bit).
o Removed importFroms that were required for updateFSA().
o Removed splines package from imports list (not needed).

o capHistConvert(): Modified.  Modifications to handle changes to capHistSum().
o capHistSum(): Modified.  Changed the returned list structure.  First, caphist.sum
    is now caphist.  Second, if only two samples are given, then only caphist and
    sum, where sum is a data frame of the required summaries for the Petersen
    method, are returned.  If more than two samples are given, then caphist, sum, 
    methodB.top, and methodB.bot are returned.  Note that there is no longer an
    item labeled as schnabel.sum returned.
o mrClosed():  Modified.  Modifications to handle the changes to capHistSum().
    Also modified so that if only two samples were summarized in a CapHist object
    and that object is supplied as the first argument to mrClosed() then the
    Petersen method will find the data it needs from the CapHist object.
o rsdPlot(): Modified.  Modified calls to min() and max() to include na.rm=TRUE.
    This fixes bug related to vectors with missing values.
o updateFSA(): Removed.
o vbFuns(): Modified.  Added 'Somers2' option to type= argument.
o vbStarts(): Modified.  Added 'Somers2' option to type= argument.


0.2-5 19Aug11
o Modified description file to show my e-mail address.
o Added cnvrt.coords() as an ImportFrom TeachingDemos.  Needed for simAgeBias()
    and simLenSelectM().

o ageKey(): Modified.  Length categories in the length sample, if none are
    provided in len.breaks=, are constructed from the length categories present
    in the age-length key rather than guessing at a starting value and width and
    creating evenly spaced categories.  This should fix the bug that occurred
    when an age-length key was originally created with even length categories but
    the key is so sparse that the length categories with actual data are uneven.
    Also, changed the error catching so that the routine is stopped if a length
    in the length sample is smaller than the smallest length category in the age
    length key but will only elicit a warning if the largest length is greater
    than the largest length category in the age-length key.
o chapmanRobson(): Modified.  Changed to have a .default and .formula method.
o chapmanRobson.default(): Added.
o chapmanRobson.formula(): Added.
o FSAsims(): Modified.  Corrected calls to growthModelSim() for von Bertalanffy
    models.
o growthModelSim(): Modified.  Changed from modeling "size" to modeling "length"
   (or "weight" for just "vbTypicalW" and "vbOriginalW").  Changes required adding
   two new model options -- "vbTypicalW" and "vbOriginalW" -- for modeling weights
   and leaving all of the original model options as models for length.  The plots
   represent the different characteristics (length or weight) modeled as do the
   slider bar options.  Added a max.wt= argument for use when modeling weights.
   Removed "vbBevertonHolt" as a model option because it is covered by "vbTypical"
   and was not actually implemented.  Changed order of models so that "vbTypical"
   rather than "vbOriginal" is the default model used.  Made slight cosmetic
   changes to slider bar options (e.g., "to" became "t_0").  Made changes and
   some corrections to the .Rd file.
o rsdPlot(): Added.  Still needs more thorough proofing.
o simAgeBias(): Added.
o simAges(): Added.
o simApplyAgeBias(): Added.
o simLenFromAge(): Added.
o simLenSelectM(): Added.
o simLenSelectP(): Added.
o vbComp(): Modified.  Streamlined the code.  Changed the t= argument to ages= to
    remove any possible confusion with t().  Removed the option to model over
    ages provided in the (previous) t= argument.  Instead the ages= argument can
    be used to represent the maximum age to model to.  The ages= argument can be
    a vector such that each simulation can have a different set of ages over
    which the model is evaluated.  This allows for more realistinc modeling.


0.2-4 15Jun11
o Switched to compiling under R version 2.13.0.

o vbFuns(): Modified.  Modified Wang's formulas to be for length increments.
    Added a length increments version to Faben's method ("Fabens2").


0.2-3 18Apr11
o Updated citation file.
o Added importFrom for tools and utils packages.

o ageKey(): Modified.  Added a len.breaks= argument so that an age-length key
    with variable widths for the length categories can be used.  Added an
    example to the Rd file to illustrate the use.
o confint.MRC(): Modified.  Replaced numdigs= argument with digits= argument.
    Retained numdigs= for backwards compatability.
o lwPredsComp.Rd: Modified.  Replaced use of lgrep() with grepl() because of 
    change in NCStats.
o removal():  Modified.  Changed order of items printed in the returned list.  
    In addition, if the type is one of Zippin, CarleStrub, or Seber3 then a set
    of intermediate values (k, T, and X) is also included in the returned list.
    The first change is cosmetic, the second change was made to help with some
    troubleshooting.  Added an argument to allow choosing the method of contructing
    SE for the CarleStrub method.  Created an internal function for computing the
    Zippin SE method to allow easier use with the other methods.  The help file
    was changed to make note of the non-estimable SE when No=T in the CarleStrub
    method under certain circumstances.  These changes result in a different SE
    being reported if the CarleStrub method is used and CS.se="Zippin" (the
    default) is used.  The "old" results can be obtained by using 
    CS.se="Alternative".  I have yet to find a solid references for this SE.
o summary.MRC(): Modified.  Replaced numdigs= argument with digits= argument.
    Retained numdigs= for backwards compatability.
o tictactoeAdd(): Modified.  Added capability of labeling points.
o updateFSA(): Added.  Had to add an importFrom from the tools package.
o vbFuns(): Modified.  Added Wang and Wang2 functions.


0.2-2 3Mar11
o moved to compling under 2.12.1 (32-bit)
o changed dependency to >2.11.1

o ageComp(): modified dramatically.  Primarily added the ability to test for
    bias by comparing the mean of the y-structure to the value of the x-structure
    with t-tests adjusted for multiple comparisons.  Modified the code to allow
    this to happen more efficiently and to output results in the plot() and
    summary() methods.  Also modified the plot() method so that the default is 
    to just show the confidence intervals rather than showing the CIs and the
    range of the data (use show.rng=TRUE to see the old plot).  Also changed the
    CI colors so that significant differences are shown in red (default) and
    non-significant differences are shown in blue (default) (set both col.err=
    and col.err.sig= to the same color to get the old plot).
o lencat(): modified so that vname=NULL is the default.  This will default to 
    using "LCat" as the variable name (as in the previous version).  However,
    modified the way the vname is appended to the new data frame so that if
    vname already exists in the data frame a new name will be used (vname plus
    some number).
o removal(): added just.ests= argument and changed the ests part of the returned
    value to be a vector rather than a matrix.  Both changes allowed for better
    use of lapply() for computing the removal estimates on more than one group.
    Changed from an error to a warning for situations where the method could not
    compute population estimates (i.e., because the population was not depleted).
    In addition, NAs are returned in situations where population estimates can
    not be made.  An example of computing the removal estimate for more than one
    group was added to the .rd file.  Thanks to Jon Bolland for asking the
    question that motivated these changes.


0.2-1 31-Jan-11
o catchCurve(): Modified by adding a formula method.  This required moving the
    original code into a default method and changing the age= argument to x=.
o lenFreqExpand(): Modified by adding the additional= argument (which required
    modifying the total= argument and adding an error check for the situation
    where the total fish to assign lengths is not greater than the number of 
    fish in the measured subsample).
o .onLoad(): modified.  Changed to include version number of loaded version.
o vbFuns(): Modified by adding simple= argument.  Added a 'Somers' seasonal
    growth oscillations model and 'Fabens' model for tag-recapture data.  Also
    added, but did not check, a 'Laslett' 'double von Bertalanffy' model.
o vbStarts(): Modified by setting a catch to return a single root for st0 or sL0
    if the polynomial root found a double root.  Thanks to Giacomo Tavecchia for
    identifying this error.  Added a 'Somers' seasonal growth oscillations model.   

0.2-0 23-Sep-10
o bcFuns(): Added.  Still needs to be thoroughly proofed.
o FSAsims(): Modified to reflect srSim() change described below.
o listSpecies(): Moved internal function out of being within RSDval() and WSval()
    and then added an argument for the data frame containing the species names.
    The hope was that this would correct the "no visible binding" warnings when
    performing RCMD check but it did not.
o srModels(): Renamed from stockRecruitModels() to be more consistent with the
    rest of the stock-recruitment functions.
o srSim(): Renamed from stockRecruitSim() to be more consistent with the rest of
    the stock-recruitment functions.
o vbDataGen(): Modified use of minAge argument -- will now always back-calculate to
    age-1 but minAge denotes the minimum age-at-capture that will be modeled.
    Deleted use of cfAge variable in code.
o vbModels(): Added.
